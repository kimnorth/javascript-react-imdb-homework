Practice

Here's a component from IMDB showing opening movies this week.

Draw out the skeleton of this app on paper.
Write down the names of the components and whether they have state or props.
For example:

CommentBox - State:comments
CommentList Props:comments
Comment Props:comment
Comment Props:comment
Comment Props:comment
CommentForm State:author, text Props:handleCommentSubmit(function)
IMDB UK Opening This Week

Once you've sketched this out, implement the IMDB component in React.
